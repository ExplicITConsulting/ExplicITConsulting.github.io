<h2 id="support-promise">Our Support Promise</h2>

If your support request is due to a bug in the latest version of Export-RecipientPermissions, Set-OutlookSignatures, the Benefactor Circle add-on, its documentation, or the provided components, support is free - no exceptions.  

For all other questions, you will receive the same first-class support at a fair price.

<h2 id="rates">Rates and Value</h2>

Our hourly rate is 210.00 € net for consulting and support services.  

You are not just purchasing support, you are gaining access to our deep expertise as the developer, implementer, and consultant.  

For us, support means not only delivering high-quality solutions quickly, but also sharing our knowledge so you understand the how and why.  

This makes our support an investment in your team’s expertise, delivering immediate value.

<h2 id="scope">Scope and Priorities</h2>

The Benefactor Circle add-on is a product of ExplicIT Consulting, but Set-OutlookSignatures remains free and open-source.  

We offer premium paid support for Set-OutlookSignatures. If you prefer free community support, please open an issue on the GitHub page.  

As stated on our homepage, documentation, quotes, and invoices, the Benefactor Circle license does not include support, as support is rarely required and we aim to keep license costs fair.  

Support requests from Benefactor Circle license holders are prioritized.

<h2 id="billing">Billing</h2>

Only actual time spent is invoiced, billed by the started hour.

Invoicing occurs monthly in arrears, with a 14-day payment term.

You may define a maximum number of work hours in advance.

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>

Support is available Monday to Friday (Austrian business days) via email and callback.  

24/7 and on-call options are available upon request.

<h2 id="terms">General Terms and Conditions</h2>

Our [General Terms and Conditions](/legal/) apply in full and without amendment.
