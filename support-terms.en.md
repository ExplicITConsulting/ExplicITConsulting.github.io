<h2 id="support-promise">Our Support Promise</h2>
If your support request is due to a bug in the latest version of **Export-RecipientPermissions**, **Set-OutlookSignatures**, the **Benefactor Circle add-on**, its documentation, or the provided components, support is **free - no exceptions**.

For all other issues, you will receive the same first-class support at a fair price.

<h2 id="rates">Rates and Value</h2>
Our hourly rate is **€210.00 net** for consulting and support services.  

You are not just purchasing support, you are gaining access to our deep expertise as the **developer, implementer, and consultant**.  

For us, support means not only delivering high-quality solutions quickly, but also sharing our knowledge so you understand the **how and why**.  

This makes our support an **investment in your team’s expertise**, delivering immediate value.

<h2 id="scope">Scope and Priorities</h2>
The **Benefactor Circle add-on** is a product of ExplicIT Consulting, but **Set-OutlookSignatures** remains free and open-source.  

We offer **premium paid support** for Set-OutlookSignatures. If you prefer free community support, please open an issue on the GitHub page.  

As stated on our homepage, documentation, quotes, and invoices, the Benefactor Circle license **does not include support hours**, as support is rarely required and we aim to keep license costs fair.  

**Support requests from Benefactor Circle license holders are prioritized.**

<h2 id="billing">Billing</h2>
- Only actual time spent is invoiced, billed by the started hour.
- Invoicing occurs monthly in arrears, with a **14-day payment term**.
- You may define a **maximum number of work hours** in advance.

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
Support is available **Monday to Friday (Austrian business days)** via email and callback.  

**24/7 and on-call options** are available upon request.

<h2 id="terms">General Terms and Conditions</h2>
Our [General Terms and Conditions](/legal) apply in full and without amendment.
