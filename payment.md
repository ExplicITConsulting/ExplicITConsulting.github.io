## Standard method of payment: Bank transfer
Most of our clients prefer to pay via bank transfer.

You find all information to globally and uniquely identify our bank account on our quotations and invoices: The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and the Bank Identifier Code (BIC).

## Other methods of payment
Bank transfer is not an option for you? We offer a wide range of other methods of payment, depending on your home country: Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, China UnionPay), PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, AliPay, WeChat Pay, and many more.

Click on the "Pay using Stripe" button below to see which methods of payment are available in your country.

Clicking the following button will open a new browser tab and take you to our payment site, hosted by our payment partner Stripe.

Due to technical limitations of our payment partner, a maximum of EUR 10,000 can currently be transferred per transaction. Invoices exceeding this amount must therefore be paid with several transfers.  
This does not incur any additional costs.  
We are working together with our payment service provider to remove this limit and ask for your understanding until then.
