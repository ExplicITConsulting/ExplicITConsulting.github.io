## Standard method of payment: Bank transfer
The standard method of payment stated on our quotations and invoices is bank transfer.

This is generally more cost-efficient than other methods, as almost all other methods rely and build on the bank account level in the background.<br>This is why our prices are calculated with bank transfer in mind.

Bank transfers work internationally as banks are usually connected directly or via dedicated networks such as SWIFT, CIPS, SFMS, SPFS, INSTEX etc.

You find all information to uniquely identify our bank account internationally on our quotations and invoices: The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and the Bank Identifier Code (BIC).

## Other methods of payment
If bank transfer is not an option for you, please let us know as early as possible.

We offer a wide range of other methods of payment, depending on your home country: Different types of Credit Cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, AliPay, WeChat Pay, and many more.

Please note that the invoice amount will be increased by a processing fee of 5% due to the additional costs associated with these payment methods.
