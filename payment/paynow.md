## Welcome!
Payment via bank transfer is not an option for you, and you agreed with ExplicIT Consulting on another method of payment.

You are aware of the additional handling fee associated with this, as described on our <a href="/payment" target="_blank">Payment</a> page.

You have received an updated invoice containing the specific instruction to pay using this site.

Do not transfer money via the button below until you have been specifically requested to do so by ExplicIT Consulting. Unsolicited transfers will not be refunded, but will be considered a donation and forwarded to a charitable organization of our choice.

Due to technical limitations of our payment service provider, a maximum of EUR 10,000 can currently be transferred per transaction. Invoices exceeding this amount must therefore be paid with several transfers.  
This does not incur any additional costs.  
We are working together with our payment service provider to remove this limit and ask for your understanding until then.

Clicking the following button will open a new browser tab and take you to our payment site, hosted by our payment partner Stripe: <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/5kA9AX37u4VteBO5kk?locale=en" target="_blank"><button class="button is-link is-normal is-hover">Pay using Stripe</button></a>
