# ExplicIT adds professional services to open-source software
We sponsor selected open-source software and donate code.

We offer commercial support for select open-source software, such as for <strong><a href="/open-source/Export-RecipientPermissions">Export-RecipientPermissions</a></strong>.

We develop private and commercial add-ons for open-source software, for example the <strong><a href="/open-source/Set-OutlookSignatures">Set-OutlookSignatures Benefactor Circle</a></strong> add-on.
