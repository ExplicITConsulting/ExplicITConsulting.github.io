**Dear businesses,**
<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
<p>Open-Source Software can save you enormous amounts of money in comparison to commercial software.</p>
<p>Please consider sponsoring open-source projects to ensure continued support, testing and enhancements.</p>
<p>Invest in the open-source projects you depend on. Contributors are working behind the scenes to make open-source better for everyone - give them the help and recognition they deserve.</p>
<p>Sponsor the open-source software your team has built its business on. Fund the projects that make up your software supply chain to improve its performance, reliability, and stability.</p>
