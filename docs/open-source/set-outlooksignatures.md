## Feature overview and demo video
**Signatures and OOF messages can be:**
- Generated from **templates in DOCX or HTML** file format  
- Customized with a **broad range of variables**, including **photos**, from Active Directory and other sources
  - Variables are available for the **currently logged-on user, this user's manager, each mailbox and each mailbox's manager**
  - Images in signatures can be **bound to the existence of certain variables** (useful for optional social network icons, for example)
- Applied to all **mailboxes (including shared mailboxes)**, specific **mailbox groups**, specific **e-mail addresses** or specific **user or mailbox properties**, for **every mailbox across all Outlook profiles** (**automapped and additional mailboxes** are optional)  
- Created with different names from the same template (e.g., **one template can be used for multiple shared mailboxes**)
- Assigned **time ranges** within which they are valid  
- Set as **default signature** for new e-mails, or for replies and forwards (signatures only)  
- Set as **default OOF message** for internal or external recipients (OOF messages only)  
- Set in **Outlook Web** for the currently logged-in user  
- Centrally managed only or **exist along user created signatures** (signatures only)  
- Copied to an **alternate path** for easy access on mobile devices not directly supported by this script (signatures only)
- **Write protected** (Outlook signatures only)
- Mirrored to the cloud as **roaming signatures**

Set-OutlookSignatures can be **executed by users on clients, or on a server without end user interaction**.  
On clients, it can run as part of the logon script, as scheduled task, or on user demand via a desktop icon, start menu entry, link or any other way of starting a program.  
Signatures and OOF messages can also be created and deployed centrally, without end user or client involvement.

**Sample templates** for signatures and OOF messages demonstrate all available features and are provided as .docx and .htm files.

**Simulation mode** allows content creators and admins to simulate the behavior of the script and to inspect the resulting signature files before going live.
  
The script is **designed to work in big and complex environments** (Exchange resource forest scenarios, across AD trusts, multi-level AD subdomains, many objects). It works **on premises, in hybrid and cloud-only environments**.

It is **multi-client capable** by using different template paths, configuration files and script parameters.

Set-OutlookSignatures requires **no installation on servers or clients**. You only need a standard file share on a server, and PowerShell and Office. 

A **documented implementation approach**, based on real life experiences implementing the script in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes, contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and e-mail and client administrators.  
The implementatin approach is **suited for service providers as well as for clients**, and covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

## Buying, extending and changing licences
<!-- omit in toc -->
### Buying a new licence
Licences are to be paid in advance and are valid for one year from the day the full payment is received. There is no automatic renewal.

The cost of the licence depends on the number of mailboxes:
- Each mailbox in your environment, for which an exclusive feature shall be used, needs a licence. This includes shared mailboxes (one licence per shared mailbox, no matter how may users access it).  
- The mailboxes do not need to be named, you just have to define at least one Active Directory or Graph group containing the mailboxes, and the maximum number of recursive members for each group.

The net price in EUR currently is **1.50 € per mailbox and year**, with a minimum total sum of 100 € net per licence period.  

**Yes, that's right: Per year, not per month.**

As long as a licence is valid, it includes prioritized ticket support and unlimited free version upgrades.

We work hard to keep our prices as low and stable as possible, with the aim of only having to adjust them for inflation. So, prices are subject to change. As you pay in advance, you can and will never be charged retrospectively - and if you want to add more mailboxes during an active licencing period, you will only be charged the initial price of your current licence period for these additional mailboxes (and this only for the remaining months of your current licence period), even if the price was raised in the meantime.

Support may be chargeable. This includes workshops, implementation support, all forms of remote or on-site outsourcing, support for topics already well-explained in the documentation and support for problems with the root cause outside of Set-OutlookSignatures or Set-OutlookSignatures Benefactor Circle.

Trial licences can not be extended or re-issued. They are limited to 30 days runtime and a maximum of 20 mailboxes.
<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Order process for non-trial versions
Just place a request for quotation with the following information:
- Company name and full address
- The VAT number of your company
- E-mail addresses
  - At least one for receiving invoices
  - At least one for receiving the download link for the licence file, updates and other non invoice related information
- List of licence groups and maximum members in the following format (see [How licence groups work](#how-do-licence-groups-work) for details):

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Extending or reducing a licence period
A licence period cannot be extended. Licences are valid for one year, starting with the date the full payment is received, and do not auto-renew.

To continue using Set-OutlookSignatures with Benefactor Circle benefits, just place a new order to receive a new licence file.

You will be informed in advance that your licence is about to expire.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Reducing the number of licenced mailboxes
The total number of licenced mailboxes can not be reduced during a licence period (one year starting from the date of payment reception), as the licence fees are paid in advance.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Moving licenced mailboxes between licence groups
Moving licences means that the total number of licenced mailboxes does not change, but their distribution across licence groups. This can, for example, be necessary due to Active Directory consolidations.

Shifting licences between licence groups is possible once per licence period.

If more licence shifts are required, additional licences have to be acquired temporarily, the total number of licences can then be reduced when the new licence period begins.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Increasing the number of licenced mailboxes
When adding licences during a licence period, you only pay for the new mailboxes and only for the remaining months in the running licence period.

The new payment does not extend the existing licence period, but it increases the number of licenced mailboxes in it.

An example:
- After a trial with 20 mailboxes, you start a pilot with 110 mailboxes in mid of April 2023. The licence is valid until mid of April 2024, with the following cost:
    max(100; 110 * 1.50) = 165.00 € net
- As the pilot is a success, the number of licenced mailboxes is raised to 7,500 in July 2023.
  - The licence period does not change, the licence is still valid from mid of April 2023 to mid of April 2024, of course with the higher number of mailboxes.
- The added licences result in the following costs:
  - Year 1 total cost of 9,402.50 €, consisting of
    - Year 1 cost for 110 mailboxes for 12 months: max(100; 110 * 1.50) = 165.00 € net
    - Year 1 additional maiboxes for 10 months (July 2023 to mid of April 2024): max(100; (7,500 - 110) * 1.50)/12*10 = 9,237.50 € net
    - As long as the price is not changing, the consecutive years will cost: max(100; 7,500 * 1,50) = 11,250.00 € net

## How licence groups work
Each Benefactor Circle licence is bound to one or more Active Directory or Azure AD groups.

Each mailbox of your company needs to be a direct or indirect (a.k.a. nested, recursive or transitive) member of a licence group, so that it can use exclusive features.

Each group may only contain as many mailboxes as direct or indirect members as defined in the licence.

The user running Set-OutlookSignatures must be able to resolve all direct and indirect members of the licence group, even across trusts.
Primary group membership is not considered due to Active Directory and Azure AD query restrictions.

Licence groups are defined by the DNS domain name of the on-premises domain (or "AzureAD" for cloud-only groups), their SID (security identifier) and the number of members licenced.
- Use 'AzureAD' if the group only exists in Azure Active Directory and is not synced to on-prem. Only one pure Azure AD group is supported, it must be the group with the highest priority (first list entry).
- If you have multiple domains in a forest or multiple forests, you can have one licence group per AD domain, each licence group with a separate maximum member count.
- There must be a default group, which is used for mailboxes which are not covered by separate licence groups.  
When a licence group for the AD domain of a mailbox is defined, this licence group is used. If not, the licence group defined as default will be used.

There are three situations where Set-OutlookSignatures uses Azure AD via Graph API insteed of on-prem AD:
- Parameter GraphOnly is set to true,
- no connection to the on-prem AD is possible,
- or the current user has a mailbox in Exchange Online and either OOF messages or Outlook Web signatures should be set

In these cases, licence groups are handled as follows:
- If the current mailbox has the Graph "onPremisesDomainName" attribute set:
  - If there is a licence group associated with this DNS domain name, it is queried via Graph
  - If there is no licence group associated with this DNS domain name, the licence group defined as default is queried via Graph
- If the current mailbox does not have the Graph "onPremisesDomainName" attribute set, the licence group defined as default is queried via Graph

## Licence and script version
Licence and script versions go hand in hand, so every new release of Set-OutlookSignatures also means a new licence release, and vice-versa.

Using different versions of script and licence file is not supported, as this may lead to unexpected results.

A warning message is logged when a version mismatch is detected.

## Data protection notice
Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle licence add-on do not store any telemetry data, do not "phone home", and do not transfer any data, only the absolute minimum necessary data between:
- the end user's Windows client,
- the end user's Active Directory or Azure Active Directory,
- the end user's Exchange or Exchange Online system,
- and the file server or SharePoint Server storing the script, it's sub-components and template files.

The data transfer always happens in the security context of the user executing the program.

For licence purposes, only the absolutely required information is stored and processed: Invoice address, e-mail addresses for technical and commercial communication, licence group information (domain, SID, maximum members) and payment information.
