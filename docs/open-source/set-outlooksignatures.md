Email signatures and out-of-office replies are an integral part of corporate identity and corporate design, of successful concepts for media and internet presence, and of marketing campaigns. Similar to web presences, business emails are usually subject to an imprint obligation, and non-compliance can result in severe penalties.

Central management and deployment ensures that design guidelines are met, guarantees correct and up-to-date content, helps comply with legal requirements, relieves staff and creates an additional marketing and sales channel.

**With Set-OutlookSignatures you can do all this, and even more with the Benefactor Circle add-on.**

Set-OutlookSignatures is the open source gold standard to centrally manage and deploy email signatures and out-of-office replies for Outlook and Exchange.  
Download the free and open-source core version from <a href="https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for free.

**ExplicIT's Benefactor Circle add-on enhances the open source version with a great set of additional features and first-class commercial support.**

## 1. Overview and features
With Set-OutlookSignatures, signatures and out-of-office replies can be:
- Generated from **templates in DOCX or HTML** file format  
- Customized with a **broad range of variables**, including **photos**, from Active Directory and other sources
  - Variables are available for the **currently logged-on user, this user's manager, each mailbox and each mailbox's manager**
  - Images in signatures can be **bound to the existence of certain variables** (useful for optional social network icons, for example)
- Applied to all **mailboxes (including shared mailboxes)**, specific **mailbox groups**, specific **email addresses** or specific **user or mailbox properties**, for **every mailbox across all Outlook profiles (Outlook, New Outlook, Outlook Web)**, including **automapped and additional mailboxes**  
- Created with different names from the same template (e.g., **one template can be used for multiple shared mailboxes**)
- Assigned **time ranges** within which they are valid  
- Set as **default signature** for new emails, or for replies and forwards (signatures only)  
- Set as **default OOF message** for internal or external recipients (OOF messages only)  
- Set in **Outlook Web** for the currently logged-in user, including mirroring signatures the the cloud as **roaming signatures**  
- Centrally managed only or **exist along user-created signatures** (signatures only)  
- Copied to an **alternate path** for easy access on mobile devices not directly supported by this software (signatures only)
- **Write protected** (Outlook signatures only)

Set-OutlookSignatures can be **executed by users on clients and terminal servers, or on a central system without end user interaction**.  
On clients, it can run as part of the logon script, as scheduled task, or on user demand via a desktop icon, start menu entry, link or any other way of starting a program.  
Signatures and OOF messages can also be created and deployed centrally, without end user or client involvement.

**Sample templates** for signatures and OOF messages demonstrate all available features and are provided as .docx and .htm files.

**Simulation mode** allows content creators and admins to simulate the behavior of the software and to inspect the resulting signature files before going live.
  
The software is **designed to work in big and complex environments** (Exchange resource forest scenarios, across AD trusts, multi-level AD subdomains, many objects). It works **on premises, in hybrid and cloud-only environments**.  
All **national clouds are supported**: Public (AzurePublic), US Government L4 (AzureUSGovernment), US Government L5 (AzureUSGovernment DoD), China (AzureChinaCloud operated by 21Vianet).

It is **multi-client capable** by using different template paths, configuration files and software parameters.

Set-OutlookSignatures requires **no installation on servers or clients**. You only need a standard SMB file share on a central system, and optionally Office on your clients.  
There is also **no telemetry** or "calling home", emails are **not routed through a 3rd party data center or cloud service**, and there is **no need to change DNS records (MX, SPF) or mail flow**.

A **documented implementation approach**, based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes, contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators.  
The implementation approach is **suited for service providers as well as for clients**, and covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

## 5. Buying, extending and changing licenses
### 5.1. Price and general information
The net price in EUR currently is **1.50 € per mailbox and year** (yes, per year and not per month).

There is no minimum number of mailboxes, only a minimum invoice sum of 200.00 € net per license period.

Every mailbox in your environment for which you want to use a Benefactor Circle exclusive feature, needs a license. This includes shared mailboxes.

It does not matter how many users access a mailbox. If you want to only deploy signatures for a single mailbox being used by 50 people, you only need to buy 1 license.  

The mailboxes do not need to be named, you just have to define at least one Active Directory or Entra ID group containing the mailboxes, and the maximum number of recursive members for each group.

It does not matter how many signatures you have and how often you change them.

Licenses are to be paid in advance and are valid for one year from the day the full payment is received. There is no automatic renewal or a subscription.

As long as a license is valid, it includes prioritized ticket support and unlimited free version upgrades.

We work hard to keep our prices as low and stable as possible, with the aim of only having to adjust them for inflation. So, prices are subject to change. As you pay in advance, you can and will never be charged retrospectively - and if you want to add more mailboxes during an active licencing period, you will only be charged the initial price of your current license period for these additional mailboxes (and this only for the remaining months of your current license period), even if the price was raised in the meantime.

### 5.2. Trial version
You may want to start with a 14-day trial license.

The Benefactor Circle add-on extends the feature set of the free and open-source core version of Set-OutlookSignatures, so make sure that the core version is working correctly before requesting a trial version.  
If you look for help implementing the free and open-source core version of Set-OutlookSignatures, go through the Quick Start Guide in the readme file, open an issue at GitHub, or contact us: We are happy to help you implement Set-OutlookSignatures in your own environment as part of our fee-based support.

As soon as the open-source core version is running, it is time to take the next step:<br><a href="https://forms.office.com/r/sgKrkkd0Eb" target="_blank"><button class="button is-link is-normal is-responsive is-hover">Submit this form to gain access to a full-featured 14-day trial license</button></a>

The form collects the following information:
- Company name and full address
- The VAT number of your company (EU only)
- Contact email addresses for receiving the download link for the license file, updates and other non invoice related information
- List of license groups and maximum members in the following format (see '[How license groups work](#6-how-license-groups-work)' for details):
  - Domain the license group is located in
    - If the group exists on-prem only, or is synchronized with Entra ID: The DNS domain name of your on-prem Active Directory (which can be different from your mail domain), for example 'internal.corp.example.com'
    - If the group exists in Entra ID only, and is not synchronized with your on-prem Active Directory: 'EntraID'
  - The SID (Security Identifier) of the license group
    - The SID (S-1-…), and not the GUID.
  - The maximum number of licensed mailboxes
    - Every mailbox that you want to use Benefactor Circle features for must be a direct or indirect member of a license group. Do not forget shared mailboxes and some growth reserve.
  - If multiple license groups are defined, designate one of these groups as default or fallback group. For details, see '[How license groups work](#6-how-license-groups-work)'.

The license file contains the following information:
- Invoice address of the Benefactor Circle member
- Date until the license is valid
- DNS domain name of the on-prem Active Directory domain (if applicable), SID and maximum number of members for one or multiple license groups

To use the license file, just add two parameters to your call of Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1:
- `BenefactorCircleLicenseFile` with the path to your individualized license file
- `BenefactorCircleId` with your Benefactor Circle ID

Trial licenses can not be extended or re-issued. They are limited to 14 days runtime and a maximum of 20 mailboxes.

### 5.3. Order process for non-trial versions
<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/sgKrkkd0Eb" target="_blank"><button class="button is-link is-normal is-responsive is-hover">Submit this form to request a quote for Set-OutlookSignatures Benefactor Circle licenses</button></a>

The form collects the following information:
- Company name and full address
- The VAT number of your company (EU only)
- Contact email addresses
  - At least one for receiving invoices
  - At least one for receiving the download link for the license file, updates and other non invoice related information
- List of license groups and maximum members in the following format (see '[How license groups work](#6-how-license-groups-work)' for details):
  - Domain the license group is located in
    - If the group exists on-prem only, or is synchronized with Entra ID: The DNS domain name of your on-prem Active Directory (which can be different from your mail domain), for example 'internal.corp.example.com'
    - If the group exists in Entra ID only, and is not synchronized with your on-prem Active Directory: 'EntraID'
  - The SID (Security Identifier) of the license group
    - The SID (S-1-…), and not the GUID.
  - The maximum number of licensed mailboxes
    - Every mailbox that you want to use Benefactor Circle features for must be a direct or indirect member of a license group. Do not forget shared mailboxes and some growth reserve.
  - If multiple license groups are defined, designate one of these groups as default or fallback group. For details, see '[How license groups work](#6-how-license-groups-work)'.

The total number of mailboxes to license is the sum of the maximum members defined for each license group.

You will receive a quote within a few days. As soon as all the technical details are ironed out, you will receive an invoice and can start the payment process.

As soon as the full invoice amount is received, you will be sent an email with instructions on how to securely download your individualized license file.

The license file contains the following information:
- Invoice address of the Benefactor Circle member
- Date until the license is valid
- DNS domain name, SID and maximum number of members for one or multiple license groups

To use the license file, just add two parameters to your call of Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1:
- `BenefactorCircleFile` with the path to your individualized license file
- `BenefactorCircleId` with your Benefactor Circle ID

### 5.4. Extending or reducing a license period
A license period cannot be extended. Licenses are valid for one year, starting with the date the full payment is received, and do not auto-renew.

To continue using Set-OutlookSignatures with Benefactor Circle benefits, just place a new order to receive a new license file.

You will be informed in advance that your license is about to expire.

### 5.5. Reducing the number of licensed mailboxes
The total number of licensed mailboxes can not be reduced during a license period (one year starting from the date of payment reception), as the license fees are paid in advance.

### 5.6. Moving licensed mailboxes between license groups
Moving licenses means that the total number of licensed mailboxes does not change, but their distribution across license groups. This can, for example, be necessary due to Active Directory consolidations.

Shifting licenses between license groups is possible once per license period.

If more license shifts are required, additional licenses have to be acquired temporarily, the total number of licenses can then be reduced when the new license period begins.

### 5.7. Increasing the number of licensed mailboxes
When adding licenses during a license period, you only pay for the new mailboxes and only for the remaining months in the running license period. The license price for the new mailboxes is the list price at the time ordering the additional mailboxes.

The new payment does not extend the existing license period, but it increases the number of licensed mailboxes in it.

An example:
- After a trial with 20 mailboxes, you start a pilot with 110 mailboxes in mid of April 2023. The license is valid until mid of April 2024, with the following cost:
    max(200; (110 * 1.50)) = 200.00 € net
- As the pilot is a success, the number of licensed mailboxes is raised to 7,500 in July 2023.
  - The license period does not change, the license is still valid from mid of April 2023 to mid of April 2024, of course with the higher number of mailboxes.
- The added licenses result in the following costs:
  - Year 1 total cost of 9,437.50 €, consisting of
    - Year 1 cost for 110 mailboxes for 12 months: max(200; (110 * 1.50)) = 200.00 € net
    - Year 1 additional mailboxes for 10 months (July 2023 to mid of April 2024): max(200; ((7,500 - 110) * 1.50 / 12 * 10) = 9,237.50 € net
  - As long as the price is not changing, the consecutive years will cost: max(200; (7,500 * 1,50)) = 11,250.00 € net

## 6. How license groups work
Each Benefactor Circle license is bound to one or more Active Directory or Entra ID groups.

Each mailbox of your company needs to be a direct or indirect (a.k.a. nested, recursive or transitive) member of a license group, so that it can use exclusive features.

Each group may only contain as many mailboxes as direct or indirect members as defined in the license.

The user running Set-OutlookSignatures must be able to resolve all direct and indirect members of the license group, even across trusts.
Primary group membership is not considered due to Active Directory and Entra ID query restrictions.

License groups are defined by the DNS domain name of the on-premises Active Directory domain ('EntraID' for cloud-only groups), their SID (security identifier) and the number of members licensed.
- Use 'EntraID' instead of the on-prem Active Directory DNS name if the group only exists in Entra ID and is not synced with your on-premises Active Directory. Only one pure Entra ID group is supported, it must be the group with the highest priority (first list entry).
- If you have multiple domains in a forest or multiple forests, you can have ony one license group, or one license group per AD domain, each license group with a separate maximum member count.
- There must be a default group, which is used for mailboxes which are not covered by separate license groups.  
When a license group for the AD domain of a mailbox is defined, this license group is used. If not, the license group defined as default will be used.

There are three situations where Set-OutlookSignatures uses Entra ID via Graph API instead of on-prem AD:
- parameter GraphOnly is set to true,
- no connection to the on-prem AD is possible,
- or the current user has a mailbox in Exchange Online and either OOF messages or Outlook Web signatures should be set

In these cases, license groups are handled as follows:
- If the current mailbox has the Graph "onPremisesDomainName" attribute set:
  - If there is a license group associated with this DNS domain name, it is queried via Graph
  - If there is no license group associated with this DNS domain name, the license group defined as default is queried via Graph
- If the current mailbox does not have the Graph "onPremisesDomainName" attribute set, the license group defined as default is queried via Graph

## 7. License and software version
License and software versions go hand in hand, so every new release of Set-OutlookSignatures also means a new license release, and vice-versa.

Using different versions of software and license file is not supported, as this may lead to unexpected results.

A warning message is logged when a version mismatch is detected.

## 8. Data protection notice
Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle license add-on do not store any telemetry data, do not "phone home", and do not transfer any data, only the absolute minimum necessary data between:
- the end user's Windows client,
- the end user's on-prem Active Directory and/or Entra ID,
- the end user's Exchange or Exchange Online system,
- and the file server or SharePoint Server storing the sofware, it's sub-components and template files.

The data transfer always happens in the security context of the user executing the program.

For license purposes, only the absolutely required information is stored and processed: Invoice address, email addresses for technical and commercial communication, license group information (domain, SID, maximum members) and payment information.
