        Exports can be compared with each other in an automated way to detect permission changes and react to them.
        <h3>Groups</h3>
        Groups that are granted permissions can be shown with their group name, with their direct members, or with their recursive members.
        <h3>Move to the cloud easier</h3>
        Permission dependencies beyond the <a href ="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/permissions">cross-premises permissions supported by Microsoft</a> can easily be identified and even be represented graphically (sample code included).
