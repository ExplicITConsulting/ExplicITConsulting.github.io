## What we stand for
ExplicIT stands for specific, clear and detailed IT consulting.<br>Bold and future-oriented, always realistic and without steam talk.<br>We bridge gaps, with our heads in the sky and our feet firmly on the ground.

Whether we do this in the background or for all to see: Trustworthiness and mediation between management levels, specialist departments and IT are always at the heart of our services.

Where we cannot help well enough ourselves, our specialised partners fill the gap.

Our select group of consultants and partners have followed these principles for more than two decades, and will continue to do so in the future.
